This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## GitHub Repositories Data

The open-source section of this portfolio is powered by data fetched from GitHub. 

- **Script:** `scripts/fetch-github-repos.js` fetches public repositories and their READMEs.
- **Data Store:** `src/data/github-repos.json`.
- **Automation:** A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/fetch-repos.yml`) runs every Sunday at midnight to keep the data fresh.

To manually update the data, run:
```bash
npm run fetch-repos
```
